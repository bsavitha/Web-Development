    <blockquote><mark>'«"Good morning</mark>, little Hans," »said the Miller. '"Good morning," said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear. '"And how have you been all the winter?" said the Miller. "Well, really," cried Hans, "it is very good of
        you to ask, very good indeed. I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well." '"We often talked of you during the winter, Hans," said the Miller, "and wondered
        how you were getting on." '"That was kind of you," said Hans; "I was half afraid you had forgotten me." '<u>"Hans, I am surprised at you,"</u> said the Miller; "friendship never forgets. That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you
        don't understand the poetry of life. How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-by!" '"They are certainly very lovely," said Hans, "and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many. I am going to bring them into the market and sell them
        to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money." '"Buy back your wheelbarrow? You don't mean to say you have sold it? What a very stupid thing to do!" '"Well, the fact is," said Hans, "that I was obliged to. You see
        the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with. So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.
        But I am going to buy them all back again now." '"Hans," said the Miller, "I will give you my wheelbarrow.</blockquote>
    <blockquote style="color: yellow;">'"A plank of wood" said the Miller; "why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn. There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don't stop it up. How lucky you mentioned it! It is quite remarkable how one good action
        always breeds another. I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank. Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true friendship never notices things like that. Pray get it at once, and I will
        set to work at my barn this very day." '"Certainly," cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out. '"It is not a very big plank," said the Miller, looking at it, "and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there
        won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault. And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return. Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite
        full." '"Quite full?" said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market, and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back. '"Well, really,"
        answered the Miller, "as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers. I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind." '"My
        dear friend, my best friend," cried little Hans, "you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden. I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day;" and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's
        basket.

    <blockquote>'"Good-bye, little Hans," said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand. '"Good-bye," said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow. 'The
        next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller's voice calling to him from the road. So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall. 'There was the Miller with a large sack
        of flour on his back. '"Dear little Hans," said the Miller, "would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?" '"Oh, I am so sorry," said Hans,"but I am really very busy to-day. I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers
        to water, and all my grass to roll." '"Well, really," said the Miller, "I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse." '"Oh, don't say that," cried little Hans, "I wouldn't be unfriendly
        for the whole world;" and he ran in for his cap, <strike>…and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders. 'It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down
            and rest. However, he went on bravely, and at last he reached the market. After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he
            might meet some robbers on the way. "It has certainly been a hard day," said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, "but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow."
